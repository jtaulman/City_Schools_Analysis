# PyCity Schools Challenge

## Overview of Analysis
 The goal of this anaylsis was to determine if removing the 9th grade reading and math test scores from Thomas High School has a drastic affect on the data. The 9th graders at Thomas High School have reportedly shown signs of academic dishonesty during their state wide math and reading exams. I was tasked with removing them to see how the results change, to ultimately see if their academic dishonesty has a major impact on Thomas High School and the state.
## Results
### District Summary:
    - The district has a very low overall passing percentage because of the 9th grade class at Thomas High School.
    - That number should increase once they are removed from the data.

### More Affects:

#### Math and Reading Scores by Grade:
    - The 10th, 11th, and 12th grade scores are unaffected because we were only focused on 9th grade data.
    - The 9th grade scores across all 15 schools increases after removing the Thomas High School 9th grade class.

#### Scores by School Spending:
    - The overall scores should increase for the range of $630-644 because Thomas High School remains in that category but their test scores increased drastically. Pulling that ranges scores up as well.
#### Scores by School Size:
      - The overall scores should increase for the range of Medium (1000-2000) because Thomas High School remains in that category but their test scores increased drastically. Pulling that ranges scores up as well.
#### Scores by School Type:
      - The overall scores should increase for the Charter schools because Thomas High School remains in that category but their test scores increased drastically. Pulling that ranges scores up as well.

## Summary
    1. The scores across the board increase from Thomas High School students once the 9th grade scores are removed.
    2. The group of 15 schools see an increase in overall scores.
    3. The total number of students remains the same even though a new total is used to calculate percentages. This is because the students are not removed from the school, only their scores from the data.
    4. Thomas High School jumps to the second best school out of all 15 once the 9th grade scores are dropped. This means majority of the 9th graders failed the state exams which pulled the school average down.
